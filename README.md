### Current status: in production ⛑️  

### This repo contains the code for the Contact Page, a HTML page in which the user can input their name, email and date of birth in a form, and receive a personalized email afterwards.  
### The backend of the application is written in Java with Spring Boot, due to its powerful web application tools, and the DBMS is Dbeaver with a PostgreSQL driver, which is ran on a Docker container.  
### Code reuse, scalability and stability are vital in the construction of this project, which is why the code is always written as cleanly and simply as possible.

### Deployment (coming soon...)

### Credits  
This project would not exist if it weren't for (Amigoscode's Spring Boot video)[https://youtu.be/9SGDpanrc8U?si=3rVnZbBKxWhaZiop], which kickstarted my knowledge on Spring Boot
and gave me the necessary tools to begin this project; I highly recommend you check him out!
